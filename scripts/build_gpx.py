"""Generate one GPX file per neighborhood from docs/data/neighborhoods.json.

Reads the static dataset (lat/lon coordinates) and writes
docs/data/gpx/<name>.gpx for every neighborhood. These files are served
statically (e.g. by GitHub Pages) so external tools such as gpx.studio can
load a neighborhood by its public URL.
